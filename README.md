# Portaler

Data dumps included are from:

- https://public.portaler.zone
  - which is a free for all made mostly to allow individual users to track their progress or to test out the application. Data may be innacurate
- https://map.portaler.zone
  - this is a curated map done by a guild I created comprised of volunteers called the Mist Walkers. The data should be as accurate as possible

** NO PRIVATE SERVER DATA WAS INCLUDED IN THIS DUMP **

However, in the future I would like to allow servers to donate their old data.
